MediOCR is our final project for the semester. It is an OCR software fully capable of recognising handwritten text. [Our team](/about), composed of 5 members, is programming it in C. We are all from the 2018 international class at [Epita](http://www.epita.fr/).

The first milestone for our project was on the 20th October 2015. We presented a neural network able to recognise characters, along with a few extras, and got 17.25, which is a pretty good grade. The final milestone for MediOCR is planed on the 8th December of this year. We are presenting the project and its progress in front of a jury (aka Marwan) each time.

If you are a hacker and want to toy with our project, you can by following the ”try” link above. Be careful though, it might be in a poor state and/or require some careful tuning.

The software in itself is based on a simulation of a neural network that is trained to recognise printed characters individually. Images are optimised for legibility, split by a custom-designed algorithm into atomic parts (single letters) and then processed by the neural network.
