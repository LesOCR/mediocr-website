MediOCR is our final project for the semester. It is an OCR software fully capable of recognising handwritten text. [Our team](/about), composed of 4 members, is programming it in C. We are all from the 2018 international class at [Epita](http://www.epita.fr/).

The first milestone for our project is on the 20th October, and the final milestone is planed for the 8th December of this year. We will be presenting the project and its progress in front of a jury each time.

If you are a hacker and want to toy with our project, you can by following the ”try” link above. Be careful though, it might be in a poor state and/or require some careful tuning.

The software in itself is based on a simulation of a neural network that is trained to recognize your writing, character by character. We use for that a special sheet that is to be completed by the user. Once it is processed by MediOCR, the software can attempt to detect, read and correct handwritten text.
